<h2>ABOUT</h2><br>

<p>Hello, I'm chris. I'm currently in my final year of Communication Design at Parsons. <br><br> 
	I am a multidisciplinary designer, working between mediums such as code, animation, branding, and whatever else I find interesting. I try to think of all of my work as holistically <change></change> reaching and engaging with people in some capacity.</p><br><br>

<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<p>I've worked on branding, web design, animated short films, 3D art, photography, and video. I also have worked as a freelance designer, photographer, and videographer.</p><br><br>
<p>I work with the Adobe Creative Suite, AutoDesk Maya, Unreal, HTML, CSS, Javascript. </p><br><br>

<h2>Reach out, I'd love to chat!</h2>
